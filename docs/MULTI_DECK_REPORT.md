# Named-Deck Setup Comparison

This report is generated from [`../results/multi_deck_comparison.csv`](../results/multi_deck_comparison.csv) and [`../results/multi_deck_manifest.json`](../results/multi_deck_manifest.json).

Fixed seed: `20260705`. Trials per condition: `100,000`. Conditions: `28`. Total simulated games: `2,800,000`.

Both decks use the same derived seed for each scenario. This common-random-number design reduces comparison noise while preserving the historical shell seed schedule. `regidrago-shell` remains the default when `--deck` is omitted. `regidrago-pineco` is the Secret Box recipe with Pineco, Forretress ex, Dawn, Forest of Vitality, and Appletun `sv8-140`. The withdrawn Pineco Brilliant Blender variant is absent from the registry and results.

Turn-one full Item-lock rows are intentionally omitted and must not be reintroduced as current-paper Expanded matchup scenarios. Use the turn-two Item-lock rows. Combined lock means Rule Box Ability suppression plus Item lock beginning on turn 2.

The graph is adaptive. Held cards, prior-turn setup, legal Prize knowledge, and ordinary evolution can remove a search category. The policy reserves every additional discard cost before paying Secret Box.

## Route-frequency diagnostics

The following row is `regidrago-pineco`, no-discard-control, going second. Counts may overlap because one rejected state can miss several axes.

| Exploding Energy use | 78.576% |

## Why more Basics did not guarantee a faster deck

Four Tapu Lele-GX and two Pineco reduce mulligans, while they also lower the probability of opening Regidrago V. Active Tapu or Pineco can require a retreat or switch plan, the six support Pokémon compete for Bench space, and partially drawn Pineco pieces have value only when the full route can execute. Secret Box requires three other hand cards, while Mysterious Treasure may require another cost. Prizing can collapse the ACE SPEC, Forest, Forest Seal Stone, Pineco line, VSTAR, Fire channel, or connector path. Item, Supporter, and Rule Box Ability locks remove different parts of the chain.

The corrected planner distinguishes sequential Supporters from same-turn contention. A planned T1 Arven, Gladion, or Steven play can be followed by T2 Dawn. It also compares direct shell-style completion against the Pineco route before committing resources.

## Boundary

These percentages estimate setup readiness under the documented goldfish policy. They are not match-win rates. The model does not assign strategic value to giving up two Prizes through Exploding Energy, repeated attacks, opponent damage, gust, hand disruption, or full format legality.
